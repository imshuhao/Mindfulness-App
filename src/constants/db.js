        "Description": "<p>Our physical health and mental health are closely linked. When your physical health is affected by illness or injury, your mental health is more vulnerable. When you experience a spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting in paraplegia or quadriplegia, both the injury and side effects from treatment can affect the way you think and feel.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing a SCI you might experience changes in mobility, functionality, level of independence, employment and financial situations, the way you live day-to-day, as well as how you see yourself and relate to others. You might feel hopeless about the future and not want to burden others with your feelings. These are common responses, however support, information and effective treatment can help.</p>\n",
